# Creating-a-video-presentation-of-a-mobile-application-for-scanning-and-selecting-a-quality-product
We are developing a unique mobile application, the main goal of which is to help users choose a quality product. The key feature of our application is the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which analyzes data when scanning a product and offers users personalized recommendations. The application includes scanning functions, a detailed product card, pages for communicating with a nutritionist and nutritionist assistant, as well as social network elements and a user profile. We have an initial version of the video presentation that we can provide for reference.

The main pages of the application:

Home page: An overview of all the functions of the application and navigation.
Scanner page: The key function of the application, allowing you to scan a product and get information about its quality using AI, which analyzes data and helps the user choose the best product.
Product card: The main focus of the video presentation will be on the product card, which presents a detailed description of the scanned product. We paid special attention to its design and content, including product characteristics, tips for use, and quality recommendations. This page is already ready and requires detailed coverage in the video.
Nutritionist page: Ability to communicate with a nutritionist and their assistant, who can help with recommendations based on data obtained from AI.
Profile page: The user's personal account with information about activity and settings.
Video presentation goals:

Present the main concept and unique features of the application, including the use of AI to analyze and recommend a quality product.
Show the application interface and main pages, with a special emphasis on the product card, emphasizing its functionality, convenience and importance for the user.
Detail the product card, which plays a key role in scanning olive oil.
Demonstrate social functions, such as interaction with a nutritionist and using a profile.
Key requirements:

Video length: up to 2-3 minutes.
Style: Simple, informative and modern. The video should focus on the visual elements of the interface, convenience and functionality.
Use of design from Figma: The presentation should be based on the existing design in Figma.
Script: The video presentation script has already been prepared and will be provided to the performer for work. The artist can suggest improvements or make suggestions for animation.
Voice-over or text explanations (subject to agreement).

Additional materials: We have an initial version of the video presentation and a script that we can attach for reference. Some pages are in the process of being designed, but the main elements have already been developed, especially the product card, which requires special emphasis.
-------------
To develop the mobile application and create a video presentation of the key features, we will follow a step-by-step approach. Below is the code for the scanner functionality (AI-based product quality analysis) and a rough structure of the app that covers the main functionalities mentioned in your requirements. I'll also include the Python backend code for implementing AI-based product scanning and recommendations.
Step 1: Mobile Application Structure and Code (Frontend)

The mobile app would ideally be developed in React Native or Flutter, as these frameworks support both iOS and Android platforms. Below is an outline of the front-end structure using React Native for simplicity. For backend AI logic, we will use Python and integrate it with the mobile app using a REST API.
React Native Code for Main Pages:
1. HomePage.js

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const HomePage = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>Welcome to Product Quality Scanner</Text>
      <Button
        title="Start Scanning"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Scanner')}
      />
      <Button
        title="View Nutritionist"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Nutritionist')}
      />
      <Button
        title="Go to Profile"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Profile')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default HomePage;

2. ScannerPage.js (AI Scanning Page)

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, Text, Image, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker'; // Expo library for picking images

const ScannerPage = () => {
  const [imageUri, setImageUri] = useState(null);
  const [productInfo, setProductInfo] = useState(null);

  // Function to pick image from camera/gallery
  const pickImage = async () => {
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
      allowsEditing: true,
      quality: 1,
    });

    if (!result.cancelled) {
      setImageUri(result.uri);
      getProductInfo(result.uri);
    }
  };

  // Function to send image to backend AI model for analysis
  const getProductInfo = async (uri) => {
    try {
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('file', {
        uri,
        name: 'product_image.jpg',
        type: 'image/jpeg',
      });

      const response = await fetch('http://your-backend-api-url/scan-product', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      });

      const data = await response.json();
      setProductInfo(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error scanning product:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>Scan Product</Text>
      <Button title="Choose Image" onPress={pickImage} />
      {imageUri && <Image source={{ uri: imageUri }} style={styles.image} />}
      {productInfo && (
        <View style={styles.productInfo}>
          <Text>Product Name: {productInfo.name}</Text>
          <Text>Quality Rating: {productInfo.quality}</Text>
          <Text>Recommendation: {productInfo.recommendation}</Text>
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
  image: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    marginTop: 20,
  },
  productInfo: {
    marginTop: 20,
  },
});

export default ScannerPage;

3. NutritionistPage.js

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const NutritionistPage = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>Talk to a Nutritionist</Text>
      <Button title="Chat with Nutritionist" onPress={() => {}} />
      <Button title="View Assistant's Tips" onPress={() => {}} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default NutritionistPage;

4. ProfilePage.js

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const ProfilePage = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>User Profile</Text>
      <Button title="Edit Profile" onPress={() => {}} />
      <Button title="View Activity" onPress={() => {}} />
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  heading: {
    fontSize: 24,
    marginBottom: 20,
  },
});

export default ProfilePage;

Step 2: Backend for AI Product Scanning (Python)

You need an API to handle the AI model for analyzing product images. Below is a simple Python code using Flask for the backend, where you can integrate a machine learning model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to analyze product quality.
Backend Code (Flask + AI Model):

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import io

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load pre-trained AI model for product analysis (replace with your model)
model = load_model('your_model.h5')

# Function to process the image and predict product quality
def process_image(image_bytes):
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))
    image = image.resize((224, 224))  # Adjust size to model input size
    image_array = np.array(image) / 255.0  # Normalize image
    image_array = np.expand_dims(image_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension
    prediction = model.predict(image_array)
    return prediction

# API endpoint to scan product
@app.route('/scan-product', methods=['POST'])
def scan_product():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No file part'}), 400
    
    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        return jsonify({'error': 'No selected file'}), 400
    
    image_bytes = file.read()
    prediction = process_image(image_bytes)
    
    # Return the result (you would customize this based on your model's output)
    return jsonify({
        'name': 'Sample Product',
        'quality': prediction[0][0],  # Example output
        'recommendation': 'Recommended'
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Integrating AI Model

You can use a pre-trained image classification model or train your own model for product quality analysis. The model would take the product image, process it, and predict the quality, giving personalized recommendations to users.

    Model Training: If you need to train a model, consider using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Use a dataset of labeled products and their quality scores to fine-tune the model.

Step 4: Video Presentation

The video presentation should highlight the following key areas:

    Introduction to the app: Explain the app’s main features (Scanner, Product Card, Nutritionist).
    Product Scanning: Show how the scanner works by taking a picture of a product and displaying recommendations.
    Product Card: Emphasize the details provided about the product's quality, usage tips, and recommendations.
    Nutritionist Interaction: Show how users can interact with a nutritionist.
    Profile Page: Display user information and activity tracking.
    Figma Design: Ensure the visual representation matches the Figma design you’ve prepared.

Step 5: Deploy and Test

    Test the mobile app to ensure smooth interaction with the AI backend.
    Deploy the backend API using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
    Use Expo or React Native CLI to build and run the mobile app on both iOS and Android devices.

This application will help users choose quality products by scanning items and using AI-based analysis to provide personalized recommendations, and the video presentation will clearly communicate how the app works and the unique value it offers.
